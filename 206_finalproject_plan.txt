Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?

2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?

MOVIE


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
A dictionary that represents a movie


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?

It will represent an individual movie and additional information attached to the movie.

* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

It will have the movie title (self.title), the movie director (self.director) and a IMDB rating (self.rating) to hold its rating. They are important because they are defining qualities that will allow the user to sort and organize the database of movies.


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?

get_directors_tweets(self)


- What will the method do?
The method will get 20 recent tweets from the director of the movie.

- Will it take any additional input? 

It will not take any additional input

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

It will return a list of twitter response dictionaries
It will not change anything about the instance or instance variables

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It is useful for this class definition in this program as it allows us to find additional data about the director of the movie through twitter


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
__str__()

- What will the method do?
The method will print out the movie and its charecteristics

- Will it take any additional input? 
It will not take any additional input

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will not return anything and it should not change anything about the instance or an instance variable.


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

IT is useful for this class because it will be nice for a user to print out a short summary of a movie object and its charecteristics.

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?

Tweets
Users
Movies

* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
-text
-tweet ID (primary key)
-user
-search term
-number favorites
-number retweets

Users:
-User ID (primary key)
-User screen name
-Number of favorites that user has ever made

Movies:
-ID (primary key) (NOTE title is dangerous for a primary key, 2 movies could have the same title!)
Title of the movie
Director of the movie 
Number of languages the movie has
IMDB rating of the movie
The top billed (first in the list) actor in the movie






* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

I want to make a query to get all of the names in the movie list with their respective imdb ratings.
I want to join the director from the movies table and the directors tweets from the users table. 

* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 

I am planning to use a set comprehension and a list comprehension



* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

Set comprehensions will be useful for getting unique twitter usernames
List comprehensions will be useful for accumulating a list of tuples with the movie name and the rating



* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

It will be a text file that is a sort of "summary stats" page with a a few movie titles and summaries of their twitter data with the current date.
